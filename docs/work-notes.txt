Folder: detailed_level
	- Contains granular data by source/category/site—ideal if 
	your visual needs to filter, drill down by department, building, 
	emission source, etc. 
	
	- What can I do with these ones?
		- Use these if you want to filter, drill down, or create 
		highly customized charts beyond campus-wide totals.
	
Folder: high_level
	- These provide yearly campus-wide totals for Scope 1, Scope 2, 
	and Scope 3, and cover categories like electricity, 
	transportation, purchasing, and more.
	
	- What can I do with these ones? 
		- Perfect for summary dashboards, time series, and 
		aggregate analysis, since the structure is already 
		summarized by fiscal year and major sector.
