# Concordia College Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dashboard

![Dashboard Demo](img/GHG_Dashboard.gif)

## Overview
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard tracking campus greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption patterns. Utilized DAX calculations and Power Query transformations to analyze sustainability metrics across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Visualized multi-year trends supporting institutional carbon reduction goals and climate action reporting compliance.

## Features
- **Scope 1, 2, and 3 Emissions Tracking** – Comprehensive greenhouse gas accounting across all emission categories
- **Multi-Year Trend Analysis** – Historical data visualization to identify patterns and measure progress
- **Energy Consumption Metrics** – Campus-wide energy usage monitoring and breakdown
- **Climate Action Reporting** – Supports institutional sustainability goals and compliance requirements

## Skills & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboard design and interactive visualizations
- **DAX** – Custom calculations for emissions metrics and KPIs
- **Power Query** – Data transformation and ETL processes
- **Excel** – Source data management and preprocessing
- **Data Visualization** – Clear communication of complex sustainability data
- **Sustainability Reporting** – GHG accounting and environmental data standards

## Data Sources
The data used for this dashboard is located in the [`data/`](./data) folder.

<!--## How to Use
1. Download the `.pbix` file from the [`reports/`](./reports) folder
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop
3. Refresh data connections if needed to view the latest metrics-->

## Dashboard Highlights
The dashboard provides insights into:
- Total emissions by scope and category
- Year-over-year emission trends
- Energy consumption patterns across campus facilities
- Progress toward carbon reduction targets
